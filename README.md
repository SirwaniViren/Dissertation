# Dissertation

The initial data provided was cleaned by Valerio and his team. I then used this cleaned version of the dataset as my starting point for the investigations. There are jupyter notebooks that were used to investigate each model thoroughly. There is a clusters.py file which produced a heatmap for the clusters of patients. The code was provided by Valerio. There are many pickle files for the models and csv files used to produce the clusters.

The sbmtm.py file is part of hSBM_Topicmodel which is the work of Gerlach et al. I have made a modified version of this no_hsbm.py for the standard and degree corrected SBM.

There is also a diagrams folder which has all the graphs and plots used in the dissertation itself.
